> **Scope:** Sales-led packet index for moving from first-pilot proof to annual order readiness. Not legal advice, pricing authority, or procurement attestation.

# Quote-to-proof packet

**Audience:** founders, sales engineers, and sponsor owners after a guided Readiness Review when the buyer is ready to discuss **Evidence Pack**, **ARB Report**, or an **annual Professional / Enterprise order form**.

**Canonical conversion checklist:** [`COMMERCIAL_CONVERSION_CHECKLIST.md`](COMMERCIAL_CONVERSION_CHECKLIST.md) (send/hold/defer rules).  
**Pre-pilot quote motion:** [`QUOTE_TO_PILOT_PACK.md`](QUOTE_TO_PILOT_PACK.md) (quote → pilot start).

---

## When to use this packet

Use this index **after** `./scripts/collect-first-pilot-proof.ps1` (with `-RunId` when a committed review exists) and before asking for annual conversion. Do not treat a vague demo click-through as proof — either buyer evidence or an **explicitly accepted demo workspace** must be labeled.

The proof pipeline emits a generated companion at **`quote-to-proof-packet.md`** inside the proof folder; this document is the stable buyer-safe index that row maps to.

## Packet checklist (first proof → quote)

| # | Artifact | Where it lives | Send rule | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Sponsor proof ZIP / evidence bundle | `first-pilot-evidence/` from [`FIRST_PILOT_EVIDENCE_BUNDLE.md`](../runbooks/FIRST_PILOT_EVIDENCE_BUNDLE.md) | Required for sponsor send; disposition must not be `HOLD` | ArchLucid |
| 2 | First-value report | `first-pilot-evidence/first-value-report.md` (+ optional PDF) | ROI sections must show basis labels; demo-derived values must not read as buyer outcomes | ArchLucid |
| 3 | Pilot success scorecard | [`PILOT_SUCCESS_SCORECARD.md`](PILOT_SUCCESS_SCORECARD.md) | Complete baselines or explicit `not collected` before leadership readout | Buyer + ArchLucid |
| 4 | ROI basis labels | `go-no-go-summary.json` → `roiBasisStatus`, `roiSponsorSafe` | Must be sponsor-safe before projected dollars lead the conversation | ArchLucid |
| 5 | Procurement pack status | `procurement-deal-ready-check.txt` from `python scripts/build_procurement_pack.py --dry-run --deal-ready` | **Deal-ready disposition: PASS** before procurement reviewers receive the packet | ArchLucid |
| 6 | Route/tier/policy/nav parity | `route-tier-policy-nav-parity.md` | PASS when commercial boundary changed recently | ArchLucid |
| 7 | Demo workspace validation (when demo is the evidence source) | `demo-workspace-validation.txt` from `./scripts/verify-demo-workspace.ps1` | PASS or documented HOLD before demo-led sponsor send | ArchLucid |
| 8 | Selected tier + order form pointer | [`ORDER_FORM_TEMPLATE.md`](ORDER_FORM_TEMPLATE.md) after tier is agreed | Use only after sponsor accepts the evidence packet; prices live in [`PRICING_PHILOSOPHY.md`](PRICING_PHILOSOPHY.md) §4 | Sales owner |
| 9 | Deferred buyer requirements | `go-no-go-summary.json` → `deferredScopeReasons` | Record V1.1/V2/(B) items (SOC 2 CPA, reference customer, marketplace, MCP, connectors) without implying they block V1 proof | Sales + buyer |

---

## Annual order readiness vs deferred scope

| Class | Examples | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Annual order readiness (V1)** | Sponsor proof ZIP, labeled ROI, scorecard baselines, procurement deal-ready PASS, route/tier/nav PASS, agreed tier + order form | May proceed to annual conversion conversation when `go-no-go-summary.json` disposition is **`SEND`** and ROI is sponsor-safe |
| **Deferred (not V1 blockers)** | CPA SOC 2 report, public reference customer, live Stripe/marketplace checkout, MCP, V1.1 ITSM/chat/docs connectors | Mark **`DEFERRED_SCOPE`** in proof when otherwise ready; do not present as missing V1 product scope |
