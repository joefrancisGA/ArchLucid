# DI-020 — Nav: Sealed review records in Governance

**Wave:** desk-ia (livelihood UX wave 28) (**DI**). **Cluster:** ia. **Depends on:** DI-003.

Do not implement from the wave index. Implement only *What to build*.

## Goal

Working sidebar Governance includes the list (TB-645 name). Not “signed decision records.”

## Why

Unlisted ledger is not a home.

## Context

- nav-config.ts · drift guards

## What to build

1. nav-config + tests.
2. Working visible; Guided may wait for unlock if eval requires it — document.
3. Update NAV_CONFIG_CONTRACT if required.

## Acceptance criteria

Done when *What to build* is true and any tests named there pass. Working vs Guided split holds unless this prompt says otherwise.

## Constraints

- Working-tree safety: run `pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/agent/check-working-tree-path.ps1 -Path <file>` before editing a tracked file. Exit 2 → skip and report.
- **Do not** hide desktop review workspace tabs behind **More** (`.cursor/rules/no-collapse-workspace-tabs.mdc`).
- **Do not** merge `DraftRequests` and `Runs`. **Do not** unseal sealed records (ADR 0039).
- **Do not** change `DeterministicInsightDensityGate` `typed-engine-protected`. **Do not** add a 40th coverage engine.
- **Do not** invent live presence avatars, cursors, occupancy heartbeats, or finding-comment chat.
- **Do not** flip `AgentExecution:Mode` host default from Simulator to Real. No G-REAL-06.
- **Do not** reopen **TB-135 / TB-136**. No GTM **M-90 / M-44 / M-91 / M-92**.
- **Do not** lengthen `MUTATION_UNDO_WINDOW_SECONDS = 300`.
- TB-645 vocabulary. Sentence case. **TB-2005** form validation. Visible-boundary `Button` (no ghost/link).
- Verification: focused Vitest from `archlucid-ui/` and scoped C# tests named here. `pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/ci/agent-compile-check.ps1` when C# changes. No full-solution build, no dev server unless this file says so.
- New ADRs need **Trade-offs**, **Constraints**, and **Expected impact** (include security). SQL stays in the single DDL file per database (`ArchLucid.Persistence/Scripts/ArchLucid.sql`) plus a numbered migration if schema changes.
- OpenAPI snapshot + generated TS types when wire contracts change (`docs/library/API_CONTRACTS.md`).
- **Do not** collapse desktop review tabs. **Do not** restore breadcrumbs (TB-2090). **Do not** merge six sponsor routes this wave.
- Leftover owner: IA assessment leftovers / ADR 0079 desk — do not collapse tabs; do not re-run SY bodies. **Do not re-implement that file.** Implement only *What to build*.
